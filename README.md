# Stress_Detection_python
The proposed of this project was to reduce the number of sensors and had high accuracy for psychological stress detection.

We used a single wearable to record electrocardiography (ECG) from participants. The proposed algorithm based on signal quality indices (SQI) for reducing the noisy can divide EMG from a wearable ECG device. We want to reduce the usage of electrodes and had higher accuracy than multi-device.

There were three algorithm were develpoed:
* Signal quality indices calculation
* R peak detection
* Separation of EMG from ECG algorithm
